# Motivation

I have a confession: I don’t particularly enjoy LeetCoding. But let’s be real—it’s one of those things I’ll inevitably have to tackle someday.

So, why not make the experience a little more bearable? My plan: build a web scraper that fetches all the problems from LeetCode and organizes them neatly for **offline** use.
That way, when the _dreaded day_ arrives, I’ll be prepared!

...Alright, maybe I’m procrastinating a bit, but there are some genuine motivations behind this project:

1. I wanted to dive deeper into the world of web scrapers and web crawlers to understand how they work under the hood.
2. I’m planning to travel soon, and having problems available offline means I can stay productive even on a long flight with no internet.
3. For fun! Golang has been a joy to work with, and this project gives me a chance to experiment and build something cool!
